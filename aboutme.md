subtitle: Why I build using AI
---

My name is JaRoet. I have a full time job other then building this software. 

I got frustated with limited device access (corporate) and that everything requires cloud or is subscription based. With the rise of AI tools for assisting in building an app I thought I try that. The results where magical. Quick results, and AI that help me think about solutions. 

I have very limited coding experience and none with any modern language but it seems you don't need to. If you know what you want and you some understanding of backend and frontend techniques (CSS, JS) you get a long way. I have build version 0.5.1 of my app, which I already use as my daily driver for PKM, in 35 hours of AI assisted coding in about 3 weeks of time. Or rather not really coding but, describing wanted features, giving feedback to the AI responses, deciding what to do and testing the results.

**I don't know why anybody still is building anything without AI**

### My story
I have been a BI consultant for a long time so I do understand IT but I never really went for coding as I do not find it enjoyable. I like to have contact with client and collegues that want to know how to use and build BI. Familiair with SQL, R a bit of Pythin on more frontend languages like CSS and JS. But except SQL and R nothing at a level that you would expect to be needed to build a tool as I ded. 

Moving to a new (large) company to work more in a BI background role I was faced with the reality that installing software outside of a pre-defined set was not allowed. 15+ years of knowledge, gathered in tolls like Evernote, TheBrain (then PersonalBrain), Trillium Notes, TangentNotes, Logseq and Obsidian, was suddenly not available to me. Or only in original MD format. It felt uncomfortable ... I tried OneNote which was the only allowed one but ... yack!!

Using AI for more work-related stuff and with Gemini 3 just released I tried https://aistudio.google.com and the results where fast and good. I build JaRoet Outliner and it worked nice. In the end I decided after 2 weeks to start again with a different focus and end product in mind. A PKM tool and not only an outliner.

# The result is JaRoet PKM
