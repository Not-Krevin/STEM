<h2 id="about">About Me</h2>

I am a **Computer Engineer** student at **San Jose State University**, with the asperation to get into the **Rehabilitaion Engineering feild**, focused on Digital Signal Processing and Robotics. My work bridges the gap between theoretical mathematics (like DTFT) and real-world hardware implementation.

Currently exploring the **Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT)**. The transform is defined as:

$$X(e^{j\omega}) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n] e^{-j\omega n}$$

As im learning, I've apply this to noise-reduction algorithms in low-power sensors in personally fun test projects.
