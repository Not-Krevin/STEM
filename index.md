## About Me

I am a STEM student focused on **Digital Signal Processing** and **Robotics**. My work bridges the gap between theoretical mathematics (like DTFT) and real-world hardware implementation.

## Academic Research: Aperiodic Signals

Currently exploring the **Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT)**. The transform is defined as:

$$X(e^{j\omega}) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n] e^{-j\omega n}$$

In my research, I apply this to noise-reduction algorithms in low-power sensors.
